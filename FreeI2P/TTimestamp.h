/** 32-52 bit microsecond-resolution timestamp.
    Unix time_t is a 32-bit stored in microseconds since the January 1, 1970. This is a universal time stamp. The
    competing timestamp format is NTP timestamp format. The problem with using NTP in software is that it requires
    a lot of CPU resources to convert too and from. Ethernet cards do this in hardware. Microcontrollers typically
    use microseconds for scheduling events and use a 32-bit RTC. For these reason, The IM2 timestamp format is 
    uses (Microseconds:UInt32)(SecondsSinceEpoch1970:UInt32) format with microsecondes being the MSBs. This format 
    lends it'self well to VUInt64 compression. Timesstamps in this format are gauranteed to transfer from between
    5-8 bytes using no additional code.
