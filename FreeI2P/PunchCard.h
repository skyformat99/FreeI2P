/** A punch card for a single atomic task or expression with commands and data.
    Atomic tasks are defined as when multiple objects are required to be manipulated in a specific order without
    interruption or else errors will occur. This is not to be confused with atomic functions, which are user-coded for
    each .

    PunchCard vs Tape:
    ------------------
    PunchCard(s) are read from the door buffer. The door buffer is sized such that the Roombot will start overwriting
    that section of the buffer comfortably after that card has bee executed.

    Address Encoding:
    -----------------
    The Members and Objects TObject functions roll the function call code in with the name, description, and signature
    of the member.
