/** Sorts incoming PunchCard(s) into OperationCue and InterruptCue hoppers.
    Data comes in loosely pack, and is only scanned for correctness. There is a different CardSorter implementation
    for each communication interface protocol, but there are only three styles: Serial, Batch, and Loopback. The most
    expensive operations are memory read and write operations, so these different read-write strategies are used
    depending on the device.

    Serial Sorters:
    ---------------
    Serial sorters stream bytes one at a time. The most optimal way of reading a UART port is read x bytes (usually 16)
    at a time in a single interrupt.

    Batch Sorters:
    --------------
    This is Batch Scanning is where packages arrive in larger packets or complete programs. Bluetooth and TCP/UDP are
    good examples of batch scanners.
