/** An I2P Keypunch that for making PunchCard(s).
    A keypunch can on write packed punch cards. Keypunches cannot read PunchCards. Keypunches can be hooked up to output
    streams have their buffer be sent through a slot to another room. On the other side of the room is a
    CardSorter that scans the packed punch card, unpacks and word-aligns instructions, and has another Keypunch
    for automated talkback responses when errors occur, or when making connections (probably some other places too.).

    A Keypunch gets it's memory from the Roombot. This allows for a single statically allocated array to be split up
    between all of the doors in the room.
