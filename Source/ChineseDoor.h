/** An Chinese Door that connects two Chinese Rooms.
    A door is a a connection node between two machine that allows data to pass between two rooms.

    A door functions differently inside of a shared library then then it does in an application where the source is
    directly imported into the software/firmware. When using a shared library, there is no access to IO ports.  For
    this reason, the ChineseDoor object is now included in the shared library, but instead is manually copied into the
    target source directory.

    Stream Sources:
    ---------------
    * UART

    Future Stream Sources:
    ----------------------
    * SPI
    * I2C
    * Multi-UART
    * TCP/UDP
    * Bluetooth
    * CAN
